        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        <p>My name is phandavhudzi rotshidzwa.im a final year student at university of limpopo doing computer science.</p>

        <h5>FINAL YEAR PROJECT</h5>

        <p>During my final year i did a project with my groupmates.The name of the project was PAGEANT LOCATER,
          it was an app for model and pageant organisers to be able to interact simply and safely as lot of models
          undergoes lot scams of fake pageants.We coded the app using android studio and KOTLIN as a backend language
          and XML for frount end.</p>


        <h5>HACKATHON</h5>

        <p>Again in my final year i joined limpopo first hackthon competition hosted by TUT and our idea was to create an app
          where a patient walks with a medical record and the target market was public hospitals as private hospitals have it
          already.</p>

        <p>The language we used was JAVA and the prototype of the app we did it with FIGMA AWS AMPLIFIER</p>


        <p>The competition happenned for 3 days without sleeping and through that i learned a lot about software development and i enjoyed.</p>
